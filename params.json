{"name":"Freshflesh","tagline":"HTML5 WebGL/Canvas game engine","body":"FreshFlesh\r\n==========\r\n\r\n[![release](http://img.shields.io/badge/current%20release-Tortuga%20(v0.3.2__alpha)-green.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dackmin/FreshFlesh/releases/tag/v0.3_alpha)\r\n[![download](http://img.shields.io/badge/download%20latest%20minified%20js-70KB-blue.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/dackmin/FreshFlesh/releases/download/v0.3_alpha/freshflesh-v0.3.2_alpha.min.js)\r\n\r\n\r\nFresh Flesh is a fast/lightweight Javascript WebGL/Canvas game engine based on [WebGL-2D](https://github.com/gameclosure/webgl-2d) library (for WebGL render) and Canvas API. It allows you to create simple games in minutes by providing useful built-in game functions (for RPGs, TPS, ...).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis engine is subject to the terms and conditions defined in the 'LICENSE' file, which is part of this source code package. Please refer to this file if you have any question concerning product licence.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nIf you don't want to download the compressed version of Fresh Flesh everytime you create a game, simply use the latest release in the master branch of this git, like the following :\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src='https://rawgit.com/dackmin/FreshFlesh/master/bin/freshflesh-latest.js'></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnless Rawgit suddenly closes, it will never change.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFresh Flesh was made to strictly follow the common game loop structure : `Setup -> Update -> Draw`.\r\nYou first create a GameState :\r\n\r\n```\r\nfunction MainGameState(){\r\n\tthis.setup = function(){\r\n\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tthis.update = function(){\r\n\r\n\t};\r\n\r\n\tthis.draw = function(){\r\n\r\n\t};\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou then add some stuff in your gamestate .setup() function :\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar mySprite = new FF.Sprite({ image : \"res/pig.png\" });\r\nthis.add(mySprite);\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finaly, you can create & launch your game :\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar GAMESTATE = new MainGameState();\r\nvar GAME = new FF.Game(MAIN_GAMESTATE, { background : \"#000\" });\r\nGAME.launch();\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n\r\nTo see a living example of Fresh Flesh usage, you can look at my [Cheezy The Pig](https://github.com/dackmin/CheezyThePig) repository.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
